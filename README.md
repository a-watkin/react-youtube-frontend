# Youtube frontend

Allows for searching for videos with instant search.

Five results are returned, each can be clicked on and will load in the main area to watch.

These are displayed as embeded videos. Which can be useful for getting around youtube restrictions.

Using:

1. React
2. Lodash (to limit search frequency)
3. ES6
4. CSS
5. Youtube API
